# LED-Automation-Effects
In undergrad, my living room ceiling had LED strips that were connected to a my roommate's BeagleBone SBC. He wrote a simple server exposing the RGB PWM channels to the network. I wrote the code here to control the lights. The defining feature is its use of yahoo's weather API in order to change the lighting effects. 

Like many projects I never did complete it and have not setup LED strips in my apartment since. I do intend to at some point and thus I am keeping this codebase around for archival purposes.

## Fork Notes
I forked this repo from an alt account that I am planning on deleting soon.
